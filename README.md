For our Machine Learning for Scientists course project, we implemented Machine Learning models using Leukemia gene expression data. We built three classifier models and tested the performance metrics of each model. 
Our implementations included k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression classification models. Our implementation used a one-versus-rest approach due to the multiclass nature of our data.
